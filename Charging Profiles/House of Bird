# Info   : Charging Profiles for House of Bird #
# Version: 1.0.0 #

# This script sets up charging profiles for the House of Bird project.
# It configures the necessary parameters for efficient energy management.
# These necessary parameters include battery sizing, different vehicle types, charging rates, and charging amounts
